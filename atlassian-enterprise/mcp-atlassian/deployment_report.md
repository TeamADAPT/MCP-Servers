   - `src/mcp_atlassian/config.py` - Updated with feature flags system
   - `src/mcp_atlassian/enhanced_jira.py` - Enhanced Jira manager implementation
   - `src/mcp_atlassian/server_enhanced_jira.py` - Server integration for enhanced Jira tools
   - `src/mcp_atlassian/feature_flags.py` - Adapter for compatibility with existing code

2. **Test Files**:
   - `tests/test_enhanced_jira.py` - Tests for enhanced Jira functionality

3. **Documentation**:
   - `docs/enhanced_jira_integration.md` - Comprehensive documentation

4. **Backup Files**: 
   - All existing files were backed up with `.bak` extension before replacement

## Implementation Details

### Feature Flags System

A comprehensive feature flags system has been implemented that allows for conditional enablement of features:

- Environment variable-based configuration:
  ```bash
  export MCP_ATLASSIAN_FEATURE_FLAGS="ENHANCED_JIRA,BITBUCKET_INTEGRATION"
  # or
  export MCP_ATLASSIAN_ENABLE_ENHANCED_JIRA="true"
  ```

- Runtime toggling of features through a simple API:
  ```python
  from src.mcp_atlassian.feature_flags import enable_feature, disable_feature
  
  enable_feature("ENHANCED_JIRA")
  disable_feature("ENHANCED_JIRA")
  ```

### Enhanced Jira Features

The following enhanced Jira features have been implemented:

1. **Custom Field Management**:
   - Get custom fields defined in Jira
   - Create global field contexts
   - Assign fields to projects
   - Check field availability

2. **Advanced Functionality**:
   - Bulk operations for issues and links
   - Project health analysis
   - Sprint reporting
   - Advanced search capabilities

3. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Caching system for frequently accessed data
   - Retry logic for API requests
   - Rate limiting to avoid API throttling

## Testing Notes

The current environment has a dependency issue with the `idna` package which is preventing the execution of tests. This issue is unrelated to our changes and affects the entire application.

The specific error is:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'idna.core'
```

This is likely due to a version mismatch or incomplete installation of the `idna` package in the Python environment. To resolve this issue, the system administrator may need to:

1. Reinstall the `idna` package:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade idna
   ```

2. Check for conflicting versions:
   ```bash
   pip list | grep idna
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment with the correct dependencies.

## Configuration for Production

To enable the Enhanced Jira features in production, set the following environment variables:

```bash
export MCP_ATLASSIAN_FEATURE_FLAGS="ENHANCED_JIRA"
# or
export MCP_ATLASSIAN_ENABLE_ENHANCED_JIRA="true"
```

And restart the MCP Atlassian service.

## Rollback Instructions

If issues are encountered, the following rollback steps can be taken:

1. Restore the backed up files:
   ```bash
   for file in /data-nova/ax/DevOps/mcp/mcp-troubleshoot/Atlassian-connection/mcp-atlassian/src/mcp_atlassian/*.bak; do
     cp $file ${file%.bak}
   done
   ```

2. Disable the Enhanced Jira feature flag:
   ```bash
   unset MCP_ATLASSIAN_FEATURE_FLAGS
   unset MCP_ATLASSIAN_ENABLE_ENHANCED_JIRA
   ```

3. Restart the MCP Atlassian service.

## Next Steps

1. Resolve the dependency issue with the `idna` package
2. Run the full test suite to verify the implementation
3. Monitor the application logs for any issues related to the Enhanced Jira features
4. Proceed with the next phase of the implementation plan
