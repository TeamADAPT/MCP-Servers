# Custom Fields Fix Implementation Report

## Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The custom fields fix has been successfully implemented and tested. This fix addresses the issue where two Jira custom fields were hardcoded with default values:

- `customfield_10057` ("name") - previously hardcoded as ["Stella"]
- `customfield_10058` ("Dept") - previously hardcoded as ["DevOps-MCP"]

## Changes Made

1. Modified `src/mcp_atlassian/jira.py`:
   - Updated the `create_issue` and `create_epic` methods to require name and dept parameters
   - Added validation to ensure these parameters are provided
   - Modified the methods to use the provided values instead of hardcoded defaults

2. Updated `src/mcp_atlassian/server.py`:
   - Updated the tool schemas for jira_create_issue and jira_create_epic
   - Added name and dept as required parameters with appropriate descriptions
   - Fixed a syntax error in the global variable declaration

3. Created comprehensive test scripts:
   - `test_custom_fields.py` - Tests the parameter validation and value usage
   - `integration_test.py` - Tests the fix works with other components

4. Created detailed documentation:
   - `docs/custom_fields_fix.md` - Detailed implementation documentation
   - Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with the fix in version 0.2.1
   - Updated `SUMMARY.md` with the project status

## Test Results

All tests for the custom fields fix passed successfully, verifying that:

1. The `create_issue` method properly requires name and dept parameters
2. The `create_epic` method properly requires name and dept parameters
3. Both methods throw appropriate error messages when parameters are missing
4. Both methods accept and use the provided values correctly

## Integration with Other Components

The custom fields fix was designed to be compatible with other components of the system:

1. Works with the enhanced Jira functionality
2. Works with the feature flags system
3. Follows the same parameter validation pattern used throughout the codebase

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the changes to the main codebase
2. Update any client code that might be using the old API
3. Consider implementing similar validation for other API methods with custom fields
4. Continue with the broader implementation plan for the project

## Conclusion

The custom fields fix has been successfully implemented and tested. It resolves the issue by requiring users to provide values for each command, throwing error messages when fields are not provided, and ensuring values are not persistent between commands.

The implementation follows the design requirements and integrates well with the existing codebase. The test scripts ensure that the fix works correctly and can be verified in the future.
