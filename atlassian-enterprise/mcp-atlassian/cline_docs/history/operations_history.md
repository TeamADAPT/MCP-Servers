## 2025-04-19 15:45:26 - MCP-Atlassian Custom Fields Fix Analysis

**Operation Summary**: Analyzed the MCP-Atlassian server code to identify hardcoded custom fields and documented the required changes.

**Execution Path**:
1. Examined `src/mcp_atlassian/server.py` to understand the server structure.
2. Analyzed `src/mcp_atlassian/jira.py` to identify hardcoded values for custom fields.
3. Identified hardcoded values for "name" (customfield_10057) and "Dept" (customfield_10058) fields in `create_issue` and `create_epic` methods.
4. Created comprehensive documentation in `2025-04-19_custom_field_fix.md`.
5. Documented the current implementation, required changes, and reversion plan in case of issues.

**Result**: OK
