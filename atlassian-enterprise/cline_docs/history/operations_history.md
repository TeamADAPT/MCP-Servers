# Operations History

## 2025-04-19 15:45:26 - MCP-Atlassian Custom Fields Fix Analysis

**Operation Summary**: Analyzed the MCP-Atlassian server code to identify hardcoded custom fields and documented the required changes.

**Execution Path**:
1. Examined `src/mcp_atlassian/server.py` to understand the server structure.
2. Analyzed `src/mcp_atlassian/jira.py` to identify hardcoded values for custom fields.
3. Identified hardcoded values for "name" (customfield_10057) and "Dept" (customfield_10058) fields in `create_issue` and `create_epic` methods.
4. Created comprehensive documentation in `2025-04-19_custom_field_fix.md`.
5. Documented the current implementation, required changes, and reversion plan in case of issues.

**Result**: OK

## 2025-04-19 16:21:04 - MCP-Atlassian Global Custom Fields Implementation Plan

**Operation Summary**: Researched Atlassian API for global custom fields configuration and developed implementation plan for making custom fields available across all Jira projects.

**Execution Path**:
1. Researched Jira REST API v3 for custom field context management.
2. Identified key endpoints for creating global contexts and assigning fields to projects.
3. Discovered that custom fields in Jira can be made available globally with empty projectIds and issueTypeIds arrays.
4. Developed implementation plan for adding new methods to JiraFetcher class.
5. Created fallback mechanism for projects where custom fields aren't available.
6. Documented findings and implementation plan in `atlassian_custom_fields_global_config.md`.

**Result**: OK
