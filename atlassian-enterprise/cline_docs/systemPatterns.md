# System Patterns

## Architecture Patterns
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) server architecture
- Python-based implementation with modular components
- Atlassian API integration (Jira, Confluence)
- Resource and tool-based interface design
- Separation of concerns between different Atlassian products

## Configuration Patterns
- Environment variables for credentials and sensitive information
- MCP settings JSON configuration for server registration
- Virtual environment for dependency isolation
- Development mode installation for local testing
- Server initialization and startup procedures

## Integration Patterns
- Atlassian REST API usage via atlassian-python-api library
- Token-based authentication for secure API access
- Data transformation between Atlassian formats and MCP formats
- HTML to Markdown conversion for content processing
- Resource URI templates for dynamic resource access

## Operational Patterns
- Logging with configurable verbosity
- Error handling with detailed error messages
- Exception propagation to MCP client
- Resource caching for performance optimization
- Asynchronous server operation

## Security Patterns
- API token storage in environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Secure communication with Atlassian Cloud
- Input validation for all API requests
- Error message sanitization

## Notes
- Patterns will be updated as the system evolves
- Focus on maintainability, reliability, and security
- Designed for cloud-based Atlassian products
