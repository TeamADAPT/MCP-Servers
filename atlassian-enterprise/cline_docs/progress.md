## 2025-04-19 - MCP-Atlassian Custom Fields Implementation Plan

### Tasks Completed

- Analyzed the MCP-Atlassian server code to identify how custom fields are currently implemented
- Tested different projects (MCP, ZSHOT) to understand varying behavior of custom fields
- Discovered that custom fields in Jira are context-specific and require proper configuration
- Researched Jira REST API v3 documentation for methods to manage custom field contexts
- Created a comprehensive implementation plan for global custom fields in `atlassian_custom_fields_global_config.md`
- Developed a detailed fix plan in `2025-04-19_custom_field_fix.md`

### Key Findings

1. The MCP-Atlassian server implements two custom fields:
   - `customfield_10057` for "name" field
   - `customfield_10058` for "Dept" field

2. Both fields are already marked as required in the code, but they:
   - Only work in some projects (e.g., MCP)
   - Fail in others (e.g., ZSHOT) with error: "Field cannot be set. It is not on the appropriate screen, or unknown."

3. The Jira REST API provides endpoints to:
   - Create and manage custom field contexts
   - Make custom fields available globally or to specific projects
   - Add custom fields to screens and issue types

### Next Steps

1. **API Extension**:
   - Implement methods to manage custom field contexts
   - Add ability to create global contexts for custom fields
   - Build functions to assign custom fields to all projects

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Add graceful degradation when custom fields aren't available
   - Implement retry logic without custom fields when they fail

3. **Testing**:
   - Test the implementation on various projects
   - Verify the solution works for both MCP and ZSHOT projects
   - Ensure no persistent values between commands

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation to reflect the new capabilities
   - Add examples for managing custom fields

5. **Jira Administration Tasks**:
   - Identify all custom fields in the Jira instance
   - Create global contexts for our custom fields
   - Add custom fields to all relevant screens and projects

### Future Extension Ideas

1. **Service Management Integration**:
   - Add support for Jira Service Management operations
   - Implement service desk request creation and management

2. **Advanced Workflows**:
   - Add support for custom Jira workflows
   - Implement workflow transition management

3. **Marketplace App Integration**:
   - Research integration with popular Atlassian Marketplace apps
   - Add support for extended functionality provided by apps
