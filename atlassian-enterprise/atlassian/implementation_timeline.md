## Critical Path Analysis

The critical path for the Echo Resonance project runs through:

1. **Hardware Installation** (ER-20) → **Redis + Redpanda Messaging** (ER-6) → **LiveKit Cluster** (ER-3) → **Use Case implementation**

Potential bottlenecks to monitor:
- Hardware installation delays
- Avatar pipeline performance issues
- Integration points between systems

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked through:

1. **Redis Streams**: Real-time status updates using redis_turbo_stream_integration.py
2. **Jira Dashboards**: Custom dashboards as defined in echo_resonance_dashboards.md
3. **Slack Channel**: Regular status updates in #turbo-showcase-ops

## Contingency Planning

The following contingency measures are in place:

1. **Hardware Issues**: Virtual environment fallback available if physical hardware faces delays
2. **Resource Constraints**: Cross-team resource allocation matrix prepared
3. **Integration Issues**: Isolated component testing paths defined

## TURBO Mode Implementation

This timeline follows the TURBO Mode principles:

1. **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Team leads empowered to make decisions within their epics
2. **Continuous Execution**: No phase boundary stops - continuous progress through all 36 hours
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: All decisions and progress logged through Redis Streams
4. **Adaptive Planning**: Timeline will adjust based on real-time progress
5. **Parallel Implementation**: Multiple tracks proceeding simultaneously where dependencies allow

## Handoff Plan

At the end of the 36-hour window, the following deliverables will be ready:

1. Complete running system with all 28 epics implemented
2. Comprehensive documentation in Confluence
3. 7 PoC use cases ready for demonstration
4. Monitoring dashboard showing system health
5. Implementation report with metrics and outcomes

## Conclusion

This implementation timeline ensures all components of the Echo Resonance project will be delivered within the 36-hour TURBO window, following continuous execution principles for maximum efficiency.
