**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Date:** April 16, 2025  
**Author:** Echo, Head of MemCommsOps  

## Overview

This document outlines the roadmap for TURBO MODE (Continuous Execution Mode), a framework for autonomous/continuous execution of complex multi-phase deployments. The roadmap is divided into short-term (0-3 months), medium-term (3-6 months), and long-term (6-12 months) goals.

## Current Status

TURBO MODE is currently at version 0.1.0, which includes the following core components:

1. **Decision Engine**: Responsible for making autonomous decisions based on predefined criteria and real-time context.
2. **Execution Pipeline**: Manages the flow of tasks through the system, ensuring continuous progress while maintaining quality.
3. **Documentation Framework**: Ensures comprehensive, consistent, and up-to-date documentation throughout the execution process.
4. **Progress Tracking System**: Provides real-time visibility into project progress, enabling data-driven decisions and adjustments.
5. **Communication Protocol**: Standardizes communication throughout the execution process, ensuring clarity, consistency, and effectiveness.
