# Red-Stream MCP Server Resolution Memo

Subject: Decision to Rebuild Red-Stream MCP Server

## Executive Summary
After extensive troubleshooting efforts and consultation, we have decided to rebuild the red-stream MCP server from scratch. The current implementation has been archived for reference.

## Rationale for Rebuild
1. Persistent tool registration issues despite multiple approaches
2. Complex TypeScript type issues affecting maintainability
3. Unclear separation between MCP protocol handling and Redis functionality
4. Potential architectural issues in the current implementation

## Archive Details
- Location: `/data/ax/DevOps/mcp_master/red-stream/archive/v1`
- Contents:
  * Original source code
  * Build artifacts
  * TypeScript configurations
  * Tool implementations

## Lessons Learned
1. Tool registration needs clearer separation between capabilities and handlers
2. Redis client typing requires more precise type definitions
3. Socket activation implementation could be simplified
4. Error handling could be more robust

## Next Steps
1. Create new implementation with:
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Simplified tool registration
   - Better type safety
   - Clearer error handling
   - Proper socket activation
2. Start with minimal working example
3. Add tools incrementally with testing
4. Document each component thoroughly

## Timeline
- Archive completed: February 4, 2025 07:58 MST
- New implementation to begin immediately
- Will follow incremental development approach

## Additional Notes
- Original implementation remains available for reference
- Documentation and memos preserved
- System services will be updated with new implementation
- Will maintain backward compatibility with existing tools

This rebuild represents an opportunity to create a more robust and maintainable MCP server while preserving the lessons learned from the original implementation.
