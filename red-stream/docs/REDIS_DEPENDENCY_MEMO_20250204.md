Subject: Redis Server Dependency Required for Red-Stream MCP Server
Team: MemOps

## Dependency Request
The Red-Stream MCP server requires access to a running Redis server instance to function. This dependency is critical as our server provides MCP tools for interacting with Redis streams.

## Current Configuration
From red-stream.service:
```
After=redis-server.service network.target
Requires=redis-server.service
```

Connection settings:
- Host: 127.0.0.1
- Port: 6379

## Required Redis Features
The server needs Redis with:
1. Stream support enabled
2. Read/Write permissions for:
   - Creating streams
   - Reading/Writing messages
   - Managing consumer groups

## Impact
Without Redis access, the following MCP tools will not function:
- get_stream_messages
- list_streams
- add_stream_message
- list_groups
- create_consumer_group
- read_group

## Request
Please:
1. Confirm Redis server is running and accessible
2. Verify stream functionality is enabled
3. Ensure proper permissions are set for our service user
