# MCP-Atlassian Bleeding Edge Implementation

This directory contains the strategic roadmap and implementation plan for enhancing the MCP-Atlassian server with bleeding-edge capabilities.

## Overview

The goal is to transform the MCP-Atlassian server into a comprehensive enterprise-grade integration with the entire Atlassian ecosystem, including:

1. **JSM Integration** - Full Jira Service Management capabilities
2. **Enhanced Confluence** - Advanced content and space management
3. **DevOps Integration** - Bitbucket and CI/CD pipeline integration
4. **Enterprise Security** - Advanced authentication and audit features
5. **AI Capabilities** - Smart classification and automation
6. **Analytics** - Cross-product insights and reporting
7. **Marketplace Integration** - Third-party app support

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation follows a modular, phased approach that allows continuous deployment without interruption:

1. Each capability is implemented in its own dedicated module
2. Features are added incrementally, maintaining backward compatibility
3. Test coverage is maintained throughout implementation
4. Documentation is updated in parallel with code
5. The roadmap is continuously refined based on progress

## Directory Structure

- `bleeding_edge_roadmap.md` - Comprehensive implementation plan
- `implementation_notes/` - Detailed notes on implementation decisions
- `research/` - Analysis of Atlassian API capabilities and integration points

## Usage

This implementation plan is intended to be used by Claude Code to guide the development of the MCP-Atlassian server without interruption until fully implemented. The roadmap will be updated as progress is made.

Current focus areas:
1. Finalizing JSM core implementation
2. Comprehensive JSM testing
3. Implementing advanced JSM features
