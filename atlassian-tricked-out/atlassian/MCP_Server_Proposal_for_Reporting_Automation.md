# MCP Server Proposal for Reporting Automation

**Date:** April 29, 2025  
**Prepared by:** CommsOps Atlassian Team

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a proposal for creating a dedicated MCP server to handle the reporting automation requirements for the ADAPT hierarchical reporting structure. Rather than relying on the MCP dev team, I believe our team can implement this specialized MCP server to meet our specific needs more efficiently.

## Proposed MCP Server Functionality

The proposed "reporting-automation-mcp" server would provide the following core tools:

1. **Executive Summary Generation**
   - Generate dated executive summaries from templates
   - Query Jira for project data
   - Populate templates with real-time data
   - Store completed summaries in Confluence

2. **Board Management**
   - Create and configure hierarchical boards
   - Set up appropriate JQL filters
   - Configure gadgets for different leadership tiers
   - Update board configurations

3. **Notification System**
   - Send reminders for due summaries
   - Post to Slack channels
   - Send email notifications
   - Create Jira tasks for overdue summaries

4. **Report Analytics**
   - Track completion rates for executive summaries
   - Generate metrics on report quality
   - Measure time savings and efficiency
   - Provide leadership engagement metrics

## Implementation Approach

### 2. MCP Tool Definitions

```typescript
// Example tool definitions

// summary-generator.ts
export default {
  generateExecutiveSummary: {
    description: "Generate an executive summary from a template",
    inputSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        teamName: {
          type: "string",
          description: "Team name"
        },
        projectKey: {
          type: "string",
          description: "Jira project key"
        },
        templateId: {
          type: "string",
          description: "Template ID to use",
          default: "standard"
        },
        date: {
          type: "string",
          description: "Date for the summary (defaults to today)",
          format: "date"
        }
      },
      required: ["teamName", "projectKey"]
    },
    execute: async (context, params) => {
      // Implementation details
    }
  },
  
  updateExecutiveSummary: {
    description: "Update an existing executive summary with new data",
    inputSchema: {
      // Schema details
    },
    execute: async (context, params) => {
      // Implementation details
    }
  }
}

// board-manager.ts
export default {
  createHierarchicalBoards: {
    description: "Create a set of hierarchical boards for a project",
    inputSchema: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        projectKey: {
          type: "string",
          description: "Jira project key"
        },
        projectName: {
          type: "string",
          description: "Project name"
        },
        tiers: {
          type: "array",
          description: "Tiers to create (defaults to all)",
          items: {
            type: "string",
            enum: ["executive", "director", "team"]
          },
          default: ["executive", "director", "team"]
        }
      },
      required: ["projectKey", "projectName"]
    },
    execute: async (context, params) => {
      // Implementation details
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Resource Definitions

```typescript
// Example resource definitions

// jira-project.ts
export default {
  getProjectDetails: {
    description: "Get Jira project details",
    uriTemplate: "jira://projects/{projectKey}",
    fetch: async (context, params) => {
      // Implementation details
    }
  },
  
  getProjectComponents: {
    description: "Get project components (teams)",
    uriTemplate: "jira://projects/{projectKey}/components",
    fetch: async (context, params) => {
      // Implementation details
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits of In-House Implementation

There are several advantages to implementing this MCP server ourselves rather than relying on the MCP dev team:

1. **Domain Expertise**
   - Our team has deep understanding of Atlassian tools and reporting needs
   - We've already designed the executive summary format and board structure
   - We understand the nuances of each leadership tier's requirements

2. **Speed of Development**
   - We can implement exactly what we need without communication overhead
   - Changes can be made rapidly based on feedback
   - We can prioritize based on our team's immediate requirements

3. **Specialized Functionality**
   - The MCP server can be highly tailored to our reporting workflow
   - Custom templates can be built directly into the server
   - Specialized JQL queries can be embedded for our specific board structure

4. **Direct Integration**
   - Seamless integration with our existing automation scripts
   - Tight coupling with Echo Resonance and other project structures
   - Direct access to our Atlassian instance without proxy layers

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core MCP Server Setup (1 week)

1. Bootstrap MCP server using recommended approach:
   ```bash
   npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server reporting-automation-mcp
   cd reporting-automation-mcp
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up basic server structure and authentication
3. Implement connection to Atlassian API
4. Create basic template engine

### Phase 2: Tool Implementation (2 weeks)

1. Implement executive summary generation tool
2. Develop board management functionality
3. Create notification system
4. Set up analytics tracking

### Phase 3: Testing and Integration (1 week)

1. Comprehensive testing with real data
2. Integration with existing workflows
3. Documentation of all tools and resources
4. User training and onboarding

## Technical Requirements

- Node.js environment
- Access to Atlassian API (Jira, Confluence)
- Slack API access for notifications
- Redis server access for caching and pub/sub
- Storage for templates and report history

## Security Considerations

- Secure storage for API tokens
- Role-based access control for different tools
- Audit logging for all operations
- Proper error handling and reporting
- Regular security updates

## Recommendation

Based on our team's expertise with both Atlassian products and the reporting requirements, I recommend that we develop this MCP server in-house rather than delegating to the MCP dev team. We can leverage the existing MCP framework while tailoring the implementation to our specific needs.

The MCP dev team could still be consulted for:
1. Best practices in MCP server implementation
2. Code reviews to ensure we follow MCP standards
3. Advanced integration capabilities if needed

This approach provides us with the control and speed we need while still benefiting from the MCP team's expertise when necessary.

## Next Steps

If this proposal is approved, we can:

1. Create a detailed technical specification
2. Set up the development environment
3. Begin implementation with a proof-of-concept for executive summary generation
4. Present a working prototype within 2 weeks

## Resource Requirements

To implement this MCP server, we would need:

- 1 senior TypeScript developer (50% allocation, 3 weeks)
- 1 Atlassian specialist (25% allocation, 3 weeks)
- Access to development environments
- Test accounts for all Atlassian products
