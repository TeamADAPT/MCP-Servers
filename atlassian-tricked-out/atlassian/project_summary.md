## TURBO MODE Implementation

This project follows the continuous execution principles from the TURBO MODE framework:

1. **Autonomous Decision-Making:** AI agents make decisions without human intervention at phase boundaries
2. **Continuous Execution:** Execution flows through all phases without stopping
3. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed documentation maintained throughout
4. **Adaptive Planning:** Plans adjust based on real-time progress
5. **Parallel Implementation:** Multiple tasks execute in parallel when dependencies allow

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Distribute questionnaires (Epic ER-21)
2. Execute ER-20 schedule; have rack powered within 4h
3. Spin up #turbo-showcase-ops Slack channel
4. Map epics to sprints

## TeamADAPT TURBO MODE Integration

The Echo Resonance project successfully leverages the TURBO MODE framework cloned from TeamADAPT/turbo-mode repository. This integration enables continuous execution across all 28 epics without requiring human intervention at phase boundaries.

## Dashboard Creation

Custom dashboards have been configured in Jira to monitor:
- Progress by team
- Progress by component
- Epic completion status
- Timeline visualization
- Resource allocation

### Specialized Dashboards

A specialized board has been created for Stella and the DevOps-MCP team:
- **Stella's DevOps-MCP Command Board**: Focused dashboard for the DevOps-MCP team led by Stella
- **Configuration Details**: See echo_resonance_dashboards.md for complete setup instructions

## Service Management & Documentation

A complete service management and documentation integration has been established:

- **Jira Service Management Project**: ERSD (Echo Resonance Service Desk) provides request management for:
  - Hardware requests
  - Access requests
  - Incident reporting
  - Technical support
  - Change requests

- **Confluence Documentation Space**: A comprehensive documentation space has been created with:
  - Project overview
  - Service desk guide
  - Technical documentation
  - Team information
  - TURBO MODE documentation

- **Integration**: Full integration between JIRA, JSM, and Confluence ensures seamless workflow across platforms

## GitHub Integration

The project has been set up with GitHub integration via the TeamADAPT organization. Code repositories can be linked to Jira issues for full traceability.
