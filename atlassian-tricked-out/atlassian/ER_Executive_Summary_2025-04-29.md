## CRITICAL PATH ITEMS

The following items represent the critical path for the Echo Resonance project:

1. **Hardware Installation (ER-41)**
   - Dependencies: Rack space, power feeds, cooling
   - Risk: Medium (hardware availability)
   - Owner: InstallOps & OpsGroup

2. **Redis + Redpanda Messaging Fabric (ER-6)**
   - Dependencies: Operational hardware
   - Risk: Low (team expertise high)
   - Owner: DevOps-MCP (Stella)

3. **LiveKit + LiveTalking Cluster (ER-3)**
   - Dependencies: Messaging fabric
   - Risk: Medium (configuration complexity)
   - Owner: CommsOps (Keystone)

4. **Use Case Implementation**
   - Dependencies: All infrastructure
   - Risk: High (timeline constraints)
   - Owner: Various teams

## NEXT REVIEW POINT

Full status review scheduled for 12 hours after TURBO window start.
