## Introduction

Welcome to the TURBO MODE Administrator Guide. This document provides detailed instructions for setting up, configuring, and managing TURBO MODE (Continuous Execution Mode) in your organization.

TURBO MODE is a framework for autonomous/continuous execution of complex multi-phase deployments. It enables AI agents to work through entire deployment plans without stopping at phase boundaries, making autonomous decisions within defined parameters.

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- **Processor**: 4+ cores recommended for parallel execution
- **Memory**: 16GB+ RAM recommended
- **Storage**: 50GB+ free space for logs and checkpoints
- **Network**: High-speed internet connection for real-time monitoring

### Software Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Runtime Environment**: Node.js 18.0+ or Python 3.10+
- **Database**: MongoDB 5.0+ or PostgreSQL 14.0+ for metrics storage
- **Monitoring Tools**: Prometheus and Grafana recommended for metrics visualization
- **Version Control**: Git 2.30+ for documentation and configuration versioning

## Installation

### Standard Installation

1. Clone the TURBO MODE repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TeamADAPT/turbo-mode.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the TURBO MODE directory:
   ```bash
   cd turbo-mode
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the system (see Configuration section below).

5. Start the TURBO MODE services:

   # or
   python -m turbo_mode
   ```

### Docker Installation

1. Pull the TURBO MODE Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker pull teamadapt/turbo-mode:latest
   ```

2. Create a configuration file (see Configuration section below).

2. Ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Check for port conflicts and resolve

#### Issue: Execution stalling

**Possible Causes**:
- Resource constraints
- External dependencies unavailable
- Decision criteria too strict

**Resolution**:
1. Check resource utilization and increase if necessary
2. Check external dependencies are available
3. Review decision criteria and adjust if necessary

#### Issue: High error rate

**Possible Causes**:
- Invalid configuration
- External dependencies unstable
- Resource constraints

**Resolution**:
1. Review configuration for errors
