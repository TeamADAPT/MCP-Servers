## Authentication and Security

Enhanced authentication and security features provide robust, enterprise-grade security for Atlassian integrations.

### Features

- **OAuth 2.0 Support**: Secure authentication with Atlassian services using OAuth 2.0
- **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh, expiration handling, and revocation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API abuse and ensures fair resource utilization
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents cascading failures when services are unavailable
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: Detailed logging of all security-relevant events

### Classes and Modules

- `AuthenticationManager`: Central manager for authentication features
- `TokenManager`: Handles token lifecycle management
- `CircuitBreaker`: Implements the circuit breaker pattern
- `RateLimiter`: Implements rate limiting
- `AuditLogger`: Provides comprehensive security logging

## Analytics and Insights

Advanced analytics capabilities provide valuable insights into Jira projects, time tracking, and team performance.

### Features

- **Cross-Product Analytics**: Analyze data across Jira, Confluence, and other Atlassian products
- **Time Tracking Analysis**: Detailed analysis of time tracking data
- **Issue Patterns and Trends**: Identify patterns and trends in issue data
- **Custom Report Generation**: Generate specialized reports for different use cases
- **Confluence Publishing**: Publish analytics reports directly to Confluence

### Classes and Modules

- `AnalyticsManager`: Central manager for all analytics features
- Project metrics analysis tools
- Time tracking analysis tools
- Pattern detection algorithms
- Report generation and publishing tools

## AI-Powered Capabilities

AI-driven features enhance productivity and provide intelligent insights.

### Features

- **Smart Issue Classification**: Automatically classify issues by type, priority, or component
- **Content Suggestion**: Suggest issue descriptions and comments based on similar issues
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze sentiment in issue comments and descriptions
- **Predictive SLA Management**: Predict and prevent SLA breaches

### Classes and Modules

- `AICapabilitiesManager`: Central manager for AI capabilities
- Classification models for issue categorization
- Content suggestion algorithms
- Sentiment analysis tools
- SLA prediction models

## Marketplace App Integration

Integrate with popular Atlassian Marketplace apps to extend functionality.

### Features

- **App Connectors**: Connect to third-party apps like Tempo and Zephyr
- **Capability Management**: Discover and execute app capabilities
- **Configuration Management**: Securely manage app credentials and settings
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy to add new app integrations

### Classes and Modules

- `AppIntegrationManager`: Central manager for app integrations
- `AppConnector`: Base class for all app connectors
- `TempoConnector`: Integration with Tempo Timesheets
- `ZephyrConnector`: Integration with Zephyr Scale

### Supported Apps

- **Tempo Timesheets**: Time tracking, planning, and visualization
- **Zephyr Scale**: Test case management and execution

## Usage Examples

### Authentication and Security

```python
# Get authentication status
status = auth_manager.get_token("jira", "user@example.com")

# Refresh credentials
auth_manager.refresh_credentials("jira", "user@example.com")

# Check audit logs
audit_logs = auth_manager.audit_logger.get_logs(days=7)
```

### Analytics and Insights

```python
# Get project metrics
metrics = analytics_manager.get_project_metrics("PROJ")

# Analyze time tracking
time_analysis = analytics_manager.analyze_time_tracking("PROJ")

# Generate and publish a report
report = analytics_manager.generate_custom_report(project_key="PROJ")
analytics_manager.publish_report_to_confluence(report, "SPACE", "Project Report")
```

### AI-Powered Capabilities

```python
# Train an issue classifier
ai_capabilities_manager.train_issue_classifier("PROJ", "issue_type")

# Classify an issue
classification = ai_capabilities_manager.classify_issue("PROJ", "Issue text here")

# Predict SLA breach risk
sla_prediction = ai_capabilities_manager.predict_sla(issue_key="PROJ-123")
```

### Marketplace App Integration

```python
# Get available apps
apps = app_integration_manager.get_available_apps()

# Configure an app
app_integration_manager.configure_app("com.tempoplugin.tempo-timesheets", {
    "tempo_api_token": "your-api-token"
})

# Execute an app capability
result = app_integration_manager.execute_capability(
    "com.tempoplugin.tempo-timesheets",
    "get_worklogs",
    {
        "from_date": "2025-05-01",
        "to_date": "2025-05-31"
    }
)
```

## Integration with MCP Server

All enterprise features are exposed as tools in the MCP server interface:

```json
{
  "name": "analytics_project_metrics",
  "description": "Get comprehensive project metrics",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "project_key": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Jira project key"
      }
    },
    "required": ["project_key"]
  }
}
```

These can be called like any other MCP tool:

```python
result = await app.call_tool("analytics_project_metrics", {"project_key": "PROJ"})
```
