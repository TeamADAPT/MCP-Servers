# Nova Leadership System Development Standards

This document outlines the development standards, best practices, and guidelines for the Nova Leadership System project.

## 1. Code Standards

### 1.1. General Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Maintain 100% type safety (no use of `any` type)
- Follow functional programming principles where appropriate
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use asynchronous patterns consistently (async/await)
- Implement comprehensive error handling

### 1.2. Naming Conventions

- **Files**: Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `slack-connector.ts`)
- **Classes**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `SlackMessageFormatter`)
- **Interfaces/Types**: Use PascalCase prefixed with "I" for interfaces (e.g., `ISlackMessage`)
- **Functions**: Use camelCase (e.g., `sendSlackMessage`)
- **Variables**: Use camelCase (e.g., `channelList`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`)
- **Private members**: Prefix with underscore (e.g., `_privateMethod()`)

### 1.3. Code Structure

- Organize code by feature rather than by type
- Keep file size manageable (max 500 lines recommended)
- Group related functionality into modules
- Separate interface definitions from implementations
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement the repository pattern for data access

### 1.4. Comments and Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- Document complex algorithms and business rules
- Avoid commented-out code
- Keep comments current with code changes
- Use TODO/FIXME comments sparingly and address them promptly

## 2. Testing Standards

### 2.1. Unit Testing

- Aim for 80%+ code coverage for critical components
- Test both success and failure paths
- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Keep tests focused on a single concern
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Implement test-driven development for complex features

### 2.2. Integration Testing

- Test all external integrations (Slack, GitHub, JIRA)
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Use test containers for database integration tests
- Create dedicated test environment for CI/CD pipeline
- Implement performance tests for critical pathways

### 2.3. Test Organization

- Mirror source code structure in test organization
- Name test files with `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` suffix
- Group tests by feature or component
- Use descriptive test names that explain behavior

## 3. Security Standards

### 3.1. Authentication & Authorization

- Use token-based authentication for all APIs
- Implement role-based access control
- Rotate secrets and credentials regularly
- Store credentials in environment variables, never in code
- Use OAuth 2.0 flows for external service authentication

### 3.2. Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper data validation for all inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
- Implement rate limiting for public-facing endpoints
- Follow the principle of least privilege

### 3.3. Security Reviews

- Conduct regular security code reviews
- Run automated security scanning tools
- Perform penetration testing before major releases
- Review and update dependencies regularly
- Document security architecture and threat models

## 4. Performance Standards

### 4.1. Response Time Targets

- API endpoints should respond within 200ms (P95)
- Batch operations should process 1000+ items per second
- Message delivery should be near real-time (<1s)
- Heavy operations should be asynchronous with status updates
- Cache frequently accessed data appropriately

### 4.2. Resource Utilization

- Optimize memory usage for long-running processes
- Implement connection pooling for database and external APIs
- Use streaming for large data transfers
- Implement proper resource cleanup and disposal
- Monitor and optimize CPU and memory usage

### 4.3. Scalability Considerations

- Design for horizontal scalability
- Implement stateless services where possible
- Use message queues for handling high volume operations
- Design data partitioning strategy for large datasets
- Implement caching at appropriate levels

## 5. Development Workflow

### 5.1. Version Control

- Use feature branches for development
- Create pull requests for all changes
- Require code reviews for all PRs
- Use semantic versioning for releases
- Write descriptive commit messages

### 5.2. CI/CD Pipeline

- Run automated tests on all PRs
- Include static code analysis in pipeline
- Implement automatic deployment to staging environment
- Perform canary deployments for production
- Maintain a comprehensive test suite

### 5.3. Code Reviews

- Focus on architecture, security, and maintainability
- Use a code review checklist
- Provide constructive feedback
- Address all review comments before merging
- Use pair programming for complex features

## 6. Documentation Standards

### 6.1. Code Documentation

- Document all public APIs with JSDoc
- Include examples in API documentation
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep documentation synchronized with code changes
- Document configuration options and environment variables

### 6.2. Project Documentation

- Maintain up-to-date README files for all repositories
- Document architecture and design decisions
- Create and maintain API reference documentation
- Provide setup and deployment guides
- Create troubleshooting guides for common issues

### 6.3. Knowledge Sharing

- Schedule regular knowledge sharing sessions
- Document lessons learned
- Create developer onboarding documentation
- Maintain a project wiki for shared knowledge
- Document system limitations and known issues

## 7. MCP Server Development

### 7.1. Server Structure

- Implement clear separation between tools and resources
- Create standardized error handling approach
- Document exposed capabilities 
- Follow MCP protocol specifications
- Maintain backward compatibility for interfaces

### 7.2. Tool Implementation

- Create consistent tool interfaces
- Implement proper validation for inputs
- Document tool capabilities and limitations
