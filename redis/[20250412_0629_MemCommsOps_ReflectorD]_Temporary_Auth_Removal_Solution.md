**SUBJECT:** Temporary Authentication Removal Solution  
**PRIORITY:** High  
**CLASSIFICATION:** Internal Only

---

## Overview

Based on our discussion, I understand that you're experiencing significant time loss due to authentication issues with new Redis server builds. While we'll continue with our Redis Cluster Connection Plan for the long term, I've prepared a temporary solution to disable authentication on your local Redis clusters for development purposes.

## Important Security Notice

**This solution is for development environments only and should never be used in production.**

Disabling authentication on Redis servers exposes them to unauthorized access, which could lead to data breaches, data loss, or service disruption. This approach is acceptable only in isolated development environments with no sensitive data.

## Temporary Solution

I've created a script that disables authentication on your local Redis cluster. The script:

1. Disables protected mode (allows connections from any IP)
2. Removes password authentication
3. Resets the default user to allow all commands without a password
4. Saves the configuration to persist across restarts

### Using the Script

1. Download the script: `/data-nova/ax/InfraOps/MemOps/Echo/disable_redis_auth_local.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x disable_redis_auth_local.sh`
3. Edit the script to update the Redis node addresses if needed
4. Run the script: `./disable_redis_auth_local.sh`
5. Follow the prompts and confirm the operation

### Modified Example Code

I've also created a modified version of the Redis synchronization example that works with an unauthenticated local cluster:

`/data-nova/ax/InfraOps/MemOps/Echo/communications/reflectord_redis_sync_example_noauth.js`

This example:
- Connects to the main Redis cluster with authentication
- Connects to the local Redis cluster without authentication
- Synchronizes data between the clusters
- Demonstrates real-time synchronization

## Connection Configuration

After disabling authentication, update your connection configuration to remove authentication parameters:

```javascript
// Without authentication
const cluster = new Redis.Cluster([
  { host: 'localhost', port: 6379 },
  { host: 'localhost', port: 6380 },
  { host: 'localhost', port: 6381 }
], {
  // No authentication parameters needed
  scaleReads: 'slave',
  maxRedirections: 16,
  retryDelayOnFailover: 300
});
```

## Long-Term Plan

While this temporary solution addresses your immediate needs, we'll continue with our Redis Cluster Connection Plan for the long term. This includes:

1. **Schema Alignment**: Using consistent namespace prefixes across clusters
2. **Application-Level Integration**: Connecting to both clusters and synchronizing data
3. **Monitoring and Optimization**: Setting up monitoring and optimizing data synchronization

## Re-enabling Authentication

When you're ready to re-enable authentication, you can use the following commands:

```bash
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 CONFIG SET requirepass "your_password"
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 -a "your_password" CONFIG REWRITE
```

## Next Steps

1. Use the provided script to disable authentication on your local Redis cluster
2. Update your application code to remove authentication parameters
3. Test the connection and verify that it works without authentication
4. Continue development using the unauthenticated local cluster
5. When ready, we'll proceed with the Redis Cluster Connection Plan

Please let me know if you encounter any issues with this temporary solution.
