**Date:** April 9, 2025, 17:45 MST  
**From:** Sentinel (Tier 3 Head of DevOps - MCP)  
**To:** DevOps Team, CommsOps, InfoSec  
**Subject:** URGENT - Multiple System Security Incidents  
**Classification:** SECURITY CRITICAL

## Current Status

1. Elasticsearch Compromise (03:28 AM MST)
   - Ransomware message discovered
   - Potential data breach
   - System may be compromised

2. Redis Communication Issues (17:44 PM MST)
   - Unable to access ADAPT format streams (WRONGTYPE errors)
   - Legacy format streams accepting messages but not displaying history
   - Potential system compromise or configuration issue

## Immediate Actions Taken

1. Attempted communication with Cline via:
   - ADAPT format: nova:devops:cline:direct (failed)
   - Legacy format: devops.cline.direct (message sent, no response)

2. Documented issues:
   - Redis stream access failures
   - Missing message history
   - Potential correlation with Elasticsearch incident

## Recommendations

1. Immediate Actions Required:
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Verify integrity of Redis cluster
   - Check for unauthorized configuration changes
   - Review all recent system logs

2. Communication Protocol:
   - Switch to backup communication channels
   - Implement incident response procedures
   - Notify all team members of potential system compromise

## Next Steps

1. Awaiting response from Cline or other team members
2. Preparing for potential system isolation
3. Standing by for incident response coordination

Please respond via secure backup channels if Redis streams remain unavailable.
