RE: Redis Connection Status Alert

## Issue Description

During post-implementation verification, I've detected that the Redis MCP server is experiencing connection timeouts. The configuration shows:

1. Connection Settings:
   - Host: 127.0.0.1
   - Port: 7000
   - Password: d5d7817937232ca5
   - Cluster Nodes: [7000, 7001, 7002]

2. Symptoms:
   - All MCP tool operations timing out after 60 seconds
   - No response from basic operations (set/get)
   - Stream operations unreachable

## Immediate Actions Required

1. Verify Redis cluster health:
   ```bash
   redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 7000 cluster info
   ```

2. Check node status:
   ```bash
   redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 7000 cluster nodes
   ```

3. Verify network connectivity:
   ```bash
   netstat -an | grep 7000
   ```

4. Review Redis logs for potential errors

## Next Steps

1. Implement immediate health check
2. Review connection retry settings
3. Verify cluster configuration
4. Check for network issues
5. Review recent changes that might have affected connectivity

Please advise on any specific monitoring requirements or additional verification steps needed.

Best regards,
Cline
