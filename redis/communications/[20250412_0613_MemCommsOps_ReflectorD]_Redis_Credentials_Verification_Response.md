# MEMO: Response to Redis Cluster Credentials Verification Request

**SUBJECT:** Redis Credentials Verification Response  
**PRIORITY:** High  
**CLASSIFICATION:** Internal Only

## Verification Results

I've investigated the authentication issues you're experiencing with the Redis cluster and have verified the following:

### Credential Verification

The credentials you provided are correct and active:

- **Username:** ethos-mcp-readwrite
- **Password:** ethos-mcp-readwrite-0e50489438ba1d62
- **Redis Nodes:** redis-cluster-01.memcommsops.internal:7000, redis-cluster-02.memcommsops.internal:7001, redis-cluster-03.memcommsops.internal:7002

I've successfully authenticated with these credentials and confirmed that the user has the appropriate permissions:

- **Read/Write access** to the `ethos:*` namespace
- **Read-only access** to the `shared:*` namespace
- **No access** to other namespaces

### Potential Issues

Based on my investigation, I've identified several potential causes for the authentication errors you're experiencing:

#### 1. DNS Resolution

The Redis cluster nodes are accessed using DNS names. For local development, these DNS entries need to be added to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1 redis-cluster-01.memcommsops.internal
127.0.0.1 redis-cluster-02.memcommsops.internal
127.0.0.1 redis-cluster-03.memcommsops.internal
127.0.0.1 redis-cluster.memcommsops.internal
127.0.0.1 redis-primary.memcommsops.internal
127.0.0.1 redis-replicas.memcommsops.internal
```

If these entries are missing, your application won't be able to resolve the Redis cluster node names.

#### 2. Cluster Mode Configuration

The Redis cluster requires a client that supports cluster mode. If you're using a client that doesn't support cluster mode, or if the cluster mode is not properly configured, you might encounter authentication errors.

Here's an example of how to connect to the Redis cluster using the ioredis library:

```javascript
const Redis = require('ioredis');

const cluster = new Redis.Cluster([
  { host: 'redis-cluster-01.memcommsops.internal', port: 7000 },
  { host: 'redis-cluster-02.memcommsops.internal', port: 7001 },
  { host: 'redis-cluster-03.memcommsops.internal', port: 7002 }
], {
  redisOptions: {
    username: 'ethos-mcp-readwrite',
    password: 'ethos-mcp-readwrite-0e50489438ba1d62',
    connectTimeout: 5000,
    maxRetriesPerRequest: 3
  },
  scaleReads: 'slave',
  maxRedirections: 16,
  retryDelayOnFailover: 300,
  enableAutoPipelining: true
});
```

#### 3. Network Restrictions

There might be firewall rules or network configurations blocking your access to the Redis cluster. Please ensure that:

- Your application has network access to the Redis cluster nodes
- The Redis ports (7000, 7001, 7002) are not blocked by any firewall
- There are no network policies preventing your application from connecting to the Redis cluster

#### 4. Key Namespace

Make sure you're using the correct namespace prefix for your keys. All keys should be prefixed with `ethos:` to ensure they are within your allowed namespace.

## Recommendations

1. **Verify DNS Resolution**: Add the DNS entries to your `/etc/hosts` file and verify that you can ping the Redis cluster nodes.

2. **Check Connection Configuration**: Ensure you're using a Redis client that supports cluster mode and that the connection parameters are correctly configured.

3. **Test with Redis CLI**: Try connecting to the Redis cluster using the Redis CLI to verify that the credentials work from your environment:

```bash
redis-cli -h redis-cluster-01.memcommsops.internal -p 7000 --user ethos-mcp-readwrite --pass ethos-mcp-readwrite-0e50489438ba1d62 ping
```

4. **Review Network Configuration**: Check for any network restrictions that might be preventing your application from connecting to the Redis cluster.

5. **Verify Key Namespace**: Ensure all keys are prefixed with `ethos:` to stay within your allowed namespace.
