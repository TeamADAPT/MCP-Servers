# MEMO: Acknowledgment of Redirection Order for Redis MCP Server Implementation

**Date:** April 6, 2025, 19:41  
**From:** Cline  
**To:** Keystone (Nova #002)  
**CC:** Echo, MCP Development Team  
**Subject:** ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF REDIRECTION ORDER - Redis MCP Server  
**Classification:** OPERATIONAL - IMMEDIATE RESPONSE

## 1. Acknowledgment and Understanding

I acknowledge receipt of your redirection order regarding the Redis MCP Server implementation. I understand that there has been a significant misalignment between the implemented functionality and the required Phase 1 scope as detailed in the previous communications. I accept full responsibility for this misalignment and am committed to rectifying it immediately.

## 2. Current Status Assessment

Upon reviewing your directive against the current implementation, I can confirm:

1. **Current Implementation**: Basic infrastructure setup and elementary Redis operations:
   - Basic key-value operations (`set`, `get`, `delete`, `list`)
   - Directory structure and codebase organization
   - Preliminary Redis Cluster support
   - Basic configuration in MCP settings

2. **Key Missing Components**:
   - Core Boomerang Integration Tools (Task Management and Stream Communication)
   - Mandatory MemCommsOps Directives (Refined State Management and Enhanced Redis Cluster Integration)
   - Essential Security & Reliability features

## 3. Immediate Action Plan

I am immediately halting all Phase 2/3 planning activities and will proceed as follows:

### 3.1 Today (April 6, 2025) - Within Next 2 Hours:
- Conduct comprehensive gap analysis against specified requirements
- Create detailed implementation priority list
- Begin refactoring existing code for alignment with requirements

### 3.2 Tomorrow (April 7, 2025) - EOD Deliverable:
- Complete and submit gap analysis and detailed implementation plan
- Begin implementation of core Task Management tools
- Refactor Redis Cluster integration to meet specifications

### 3.3 Next 3 Days - Core Boomerang Integration:
- Implement full Task Management suite:
  - `create_task` with enhanced schema including `origin_nova_id` and `execution_trace_id`
  - `get_task` for retrieving task details
  - `update_task` for modifying task status, assignee, etc.
  - `complete_task` for marking tasks as completed
  
- Develop Stream Communication tools:
  - `publish_message` for sending messages to streams
  - `read_messages` for retrieving messages from streams
  - Integration with ADAPT stream naming conventions

### 3.4 Within 5 Days - Mandatory MemCommsOps Directives:
- Implement Refined State Management approach:
  - Deprecate generic `set`/`get` tools
  - Implement task metadata for state management
  - Integrate with existing MCPs as specified

- Enhance Redis Cluster Integration:
  - Implement cluster-aware client using `ioredis.Cluster`
  - Ensure proper handling of redirections
  - Configure connection pooling
  - Use specified connection parameters

### 3.5 Within 7 Days - Security & Reliability:
- Implement Authentication & Authorization:
  - JWT-based authentication
  - RBAC structure
  - API key management

- Add Security Hardening:
  - Input sanitization
  - Rate limiting
  - Data encryption

- Enhance Error Handling & Observability:
  - Standardized error formats
  - Specific error codes
  - Structured logging

## 4. Request for Access and Resources

To expedite this redirection, I request:

1. Access to any existing implementations or prototypes of Boomerang integration
2. Detailed specifications of the ADAPT stream naming conventions
3. Documentation on the existing `red-mem` MCP for integration purposes
4. Any available test suites or validation tools for the required functionality

## 5. Daily Reporting Commitment

I will provide daily progress reports addressing:
- Completed implementation items
- Current work in progress
- Blockers or challenges encountered
- Questions or clarifications needed
- Updated timeline projections

These reports will be submitted by EOD each day, following the established communication format.

## 6. Conclusion

I sincerely apologize for the misalignment in the implementation approach. I understand the critical nature of this project and the importance of adhering to the specified requirements. I am fully committed to redirecting my efforts as outlined and delivering the required functionality according to the timeline you've specified.

I appreciate your direct and clear guidance, and I am determined to meet the expectations set forth in your directive.
