# Security Incident Report: Potential Elasticsearch Compromise

**Date**: April 9, 2025  
**Time**: 03:28 AM MST  
**Discovered by**: MCP DevOps Team  
**Affected System**: Elasticsearch instance on `dataops-primary` (52.118.145.162:9200)  
**Severity**: High - Potential Ransomware/Data Breach  

## Executive Summary

During the implementation of the Elasticsearch MCP server, a suspicious message was discovered in an index called "read_me" which contains text characteristic of ransomware extortion. This suggests the Elasticsearch instance may have been compromised. The message contains a Bitcoin address for payment and threats of data disclosure, which is consistent with known ransomware tactics.

## Discovery Timeline

1. **2025-04-09 02:40:42 AM MST**: Connected to the Elasticsearch instance using credentials from the MASTER_CONNECTIONS.md document.
2. **2025-04-09 03:26:01 AM MST**: Successfully established connection to the Elasticsearch instance with the MCP server.
3. **2025-04-09 03:26:16 AM MST**: Listed all indices in the Elasticsearch instance, discovering 16 indices including one suspiciously named "read_me".
4. **2025-04-09 03:26:23 AM MST**: Retrieved field mappings for the "read_me" index, revealing a simple structure with a "message" field.
5. **2025-04-09 03:26:28 AM MST**: Executed a search query on the "read_me" index, revealing what appears to be a ransomware extortion message.

## Technical Details

### Reproduction Steps

The following steps can be taken to reproduce this finding:

1. Connect to the Elasticsearch instance using the following configuration:
   - URL: https://YOUR-CREDENTIALS@YOUR-DOMAIN//2info.win/ela
- A contact email on an anonymous service: rambler+5882u@onionmail.org
- An identifier: "DBCODE is: 5882U"

All these elements are consistent with known ransomware attack patterns targeting databases.

### Additional Observations

1. The index appears to have been created specifically to hold the ransom note.
2. There are legitimate-looking log indices in the system (nova-logs-* series) which suggests the attacker may have access to actual data.
3. The Elasticsearch instance health shows "yellow" status for several indices, which may be unrelated but could potentially indicate issues with the cluster.

## Affected Data

Based on the index listing, the following data may be at risk:

1. "nova-logs-2025.04.05" through "nova-logs-2025.04.08" - appear to be system logs
2. Various internal alert indices related to observability and security
3. Kibana AI assistant conversation data

A brief investigation of recent logs (nova-logs-2025.04.08) revealed HTTP headers and what appears to be network traffic, potentially including:
- User-Agent strings
- Accept-Language headers
- Other HTTP request data

## Potential Impact

If this is indeed a successful ransomware attack:

1. Confidential data may have been exfiltrated
2. System logs may have been compromised
3. The attacker may still have access to the system
4. There may be a wider compromise beyond just the Elasticsearch instance

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Isolation**: Consider immediately isolating the affected system (52.118.145.162) from the network if possible
2. **Credential Rotation**: Immediately rotate all credentials for the Elasticsearch instance
3. **Backup Verification**: Verify the integrity of existing backups before the potential compromise
4. **Evidence Preservation**: Create forensic copies of the affected system for investigation

### Investigation Steps

1. Check for unauthorized access in Elasticsearch logs
2. Review all indices for modifications or data exfiltration
3. Examine system logs for evidence of the initial compromise vector
4. Look for any modified configuration files or unauthorized users
5. Check for persistence mechanisms or backdoors
6. Determine when the "read_me" index was created and by what process

### Security Team Engagement

This incident should be immediately escalated to:
1. The Information Security team
2. System administrators responsible for the Elasticsearch deployment
3. Data protection officers if personally identifiable information may be affected
4. Senior management, given the potential for data disclosure

## Additional Information

The Elasticsearch instance was recently migrated from Docker to a Systemd service according to the master connections document. This transition period could potentially have introduced vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that were exploited.
